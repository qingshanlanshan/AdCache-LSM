# AdCache: Adaptive Cache Management with Admission Control for LSM-tree Key-Value Stores

This repository contains the source code and experiment scripts for our paper:

**AdCache: Adaptive Cache Management with Admission Control for LSM-tree Key-Value Stores**  
(*Under Submission)

AdCache is a lightweight, reinforcement learning-based cache manager that dynamically partitions memory between block cache and range cache, while applying selective admission for both point lookups and scans in LSM-tree-based key-value stores.
